# kickstarter-analysis
Overview of project explain the purpose.

The purpose of the analysis was to learn more about how Excel fits into the data landscape as we are told in 101. More specifically to the module 1 challenge the purpose is to understand the function of a pivot table and how to create one and how to get the data and to filter that data. Also how to create a line chart. Further, the purpose of the entire module is to understand the flow of data in the worksheet and how that data corresponds to tables in different sheets and can be used to provide viewers with information at a quick glance.

How I performed my analysis.
I performed my analysis using Google often and the hints given within the module. I overcame challenges by calling the ACs partner who was very helpful every time. The conclusions one can draw about the theater outcomes launched by date is that may is a wonderful time to launch a production in December is just as poor as january.

Conclusions.
Discussing the goal outcome conclusion we can see that there is a lot of inverse relationships in the line chart. In other words the percentage failed in the percent successful in the 20,000 to $25,000 goal is inversely proportionate as it is at the 35,000 Mark and the 40,000 mark. But the 40,000 marks can be most likely interpreted as outliers. This data set is limited by the outliers and the small number of our data in general. Other tables or graphs that we could use are bar, XY scatter, histogram, and maybe combination. And then making the colors different based on color choice.
